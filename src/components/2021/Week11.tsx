        <p>This was going to be my bye week but Nox said he'd hurt himself if I didn't put something out so I'll try to keep this short and sweet. So let's get at it.</p>
        <p>Well well well, look who's the most hated team in the NFL once again! That's 5 wins in a row now for the red hot Pats, and I'm about ready to blow a Gaskin! With a matchup against the first place Titans this Sunday it's possible that.... Hell, I don't want to jinx it!!</p>
        <p>Honestly other than that a pretty tame week of football. Ravens squeaked out a victory over DAAA Bears without Lamar who apparently had a bad case of IBS leading up to the game. Vikings were too much for Rodgers and his sore pinky toe, Colts embarrassed the struggling Bills and we ended Sunday with a thriller down in LA where the Steelers and Chargers had a shootout with the Chargers coming out on top 41-37.</p>
        <p>Monday night ended as we all expected, Bucs beating up the Giants 30-10.. Is it time for the hot takes and speculation? I give it this week.. Let's say the Pats beat the Titans and move into 1st place in the AFC. Just imagine the talking heads and the media shit storm. Super Bowl 56, Bucs vs Pats, Brady vs Bill.. woah woah slow down, I can only get so erect, not to mention I already blew my Gaskin!. Roger Goodell's head might explode! One can only hope. Let's move on, I might be getting a bit side tracked..</p>
        <p>Screw it, I'm jacked up! Bye-week schmi-week, JUST SEND IT!!</p>
        <p>Week 11's in the books so let's break down some film.</p>
        <p>How about Taylor and Ekeler being flat out Fantasy Freakshows. Combined for 9 or was it 10 TDs this week! Scary stuff for anyone playing the Mutts or Team Gillies... Except when you notice Taylor put up 50 and Ekeler put up 40 and both the Mutts and Gillies only mustered 125 points on the week...? Wait, what? That's a 9 point average a piece for their remaining players.. Yikes. That's a lot of weight on those purebreds.. The calm before the storm if you will.. A lot of eggs in one basket if you catch my drift.. There's an elephant in the room and he's looking at the both of you, if you know what I mean.. There are clouds on the horizon... Any of this getting through to you guys?</p>
        <p>I'm saying both your teams suck and an implosion is inevitable!</p>

        <p>Ah don't beat a dead horse..This ship has sailed.. They're called idioms, Nox! READ A BOOK!</p>

        <p>Biggest Blowout: With NPC projected to win 150 to 70 it was all but a lock to win Biggest Blowout for the 7th time but he must have conceded this week so someone else could win the honour. Congrats to Jeff Gillies for trouncing his little brother Curtis 126-74 for a blowout of 52 points. The exact number of points Taylor laid on Sunday afternoon. Poetic. Just ran him over like the dirty dog he is! Brotherly love bruh!</p>
        <LazyImg alt = 'Run Over' src = {runOver}/>
        <p>Noteable blowouts:
            <br/>NPC vs Shane Falco's Scabs - 49 (So close to 7 blowouts!! God Dammit NPC! You blew it!)
            <br/>Mutts vs The Nimble Bubblers - 45
            <br/>Moran's Misfits vs Rondinko - 32
        </p>
        <p>Other than that it was a pretty tame weekend. When RuCunt and The Rippers 108-91 matchup was the tightest of the week you've got yourself a pretty stress-free weekend from everyone. I mean, sure.. The Rippers benched the Number 1 QB in football so he could watch Dak put up 2 points but I'm sure he doesn't need to be reminded about that. Or the fact he could have fed RuCunt his 6th straight loss if he just started his best player but again, what are ya gonna do. I'm sure The Rippers are not too hung up on it. It's not like it's the matchup he was looking forward to all season long and fell completely on his face in the biggest moment.. I'm sure he's fine..</p>
        <LazyImg alt = 'Rain Sad' src = {rainSad2}/>
        <p>Riiiight... You'll be ok Rippers. Team is looking stacked for that 2022 draft!</p>
        <p>Hmmm what else.. oh yes! LouCrew's perfect season is alive and well. Going into the matchup vs TimmaysGuts things were actually projected to be pretty close. I think we can all imagine Tim's fear when he saw the news on Sunday before kickoff that Lamar ate some bad beef at Taco Bell and his IBS acted up. Must have been pretty bad for him to have to skip the game, but hey, I get it. We've all been there. Either way that was about as close as it got. LouCrew loses 103-82. 0-2 on the week and 0-22 on the season. Timmays studs came to play and Louie's best player continues to be his kicker and that's just not going to cut it most weeks. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Big Dick Nick Folk, but he ain't going to put up the 30 extra points Louie needs every week in order to get a win. But I'm feeling generous, and have a feeling something magical is coming. LouCrew is going to silence the haters soon and it might just be thanks to the Folk Hero himself. Here's a peace offering LouCrew. If you win a matchup before the regular season ends AND Folk has more than 10 points on the day, you can change your team info. I'm a generous God. I've already found the perfect name and logo for such a special occasion.</p>

        <p>We've got NPC and RuCunt locked in at the top since week 1 while we've watched 3rd to 6th place change more times than Nox's gender. We've got 1 team at 18-4, 1 team at 16-6, 5 teams at 12-10 and 2 at 11-11 battling it out for 6 playoff spots. 3 weeks left fellas, this is getting good. Not sure we've ever had so much on the line this late in the season. Get after it!</p>
        <p>And with that let's wrap this week up and move on to week 12! Looks like a few people hit the Panic Trade Button going into this week so it's certainly something to keep an eye on.</p>
        <p>Set those lineups folks! </p>
