        <p>The Patriots are now 3-4 and second place in the AFC East and have the same record as the Chiefs. They're 3 bone head plays aways from being 6-1 folks. Life is good. Not sure who wants to hear these facts but I will continue to relay them until Whitey admits Mac Jones is a god damn stud and the best QB out of this draft. I mean, look at his pace, Curt!! Look at it!! 54-13 over the Jets. LOVE IT!

        <p>There were a lot of lows this week so I think that's what we should focus on..</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First things first let's address how this week kicked off with RuCunts big move. Guy's made maybe 3 roster adds all season. Meticulously climbing the waiver ladder up to the #1 spot. Where he holds it for 6 straight weeks. Smart strategy. Championship winning strategy.. Almost like he knows what he's do....wait... Then you remember Rupe has no idea what a waiver is let alone what waiver priority means. And that's how we all woke up scratching our collective heads Friday morning when we saw had Rupe used his #1 Waiver on The Green Bay Packers... A Defense.. On a Friday.. When he could have just waited until Friday morning when waivers cleared and got them as a Free Agent...</p>
                <LazyImg alt = 'Rupe laugh waiver' src = {rupeLaughWaiver}/>
                <p>Sure, if this is the 2019 Pats or the 2010 Chicago Bears defense where they averaged 19 points a game, yeah fire up that #1 Waiver and forget about it.. But the Packers? Middle of the road Packers? When you could have so easily gotten them for free? Congrats on the 14 points from GB and your second Biggest Blow Out Award win over Timmay(Also Timmay's second back to back on the losing end) but a move like that can have grave consequences, Rupe.. I say all this but after 5 years in the league I still don't think Rupe knows what we're all laughing about. Keep on keepin on, Rupe! I for one love it and just got one spot closer to #1 Priority! This might be our season's TSN Turning Point fellas! Buckle up!</p>

                <p>Well, Jeff started Fields again and This Justin...Fields was miserable against the Bucs! I mean we're talking MISERABLE! Just read that Sleeper Update! Apparently Jeff missed the memo because he's carrying and starting multiple Bears every week.</p>
                <LazyImg alt = {`I've once again made a huge mistake`}src = {mistakeJeffFields}/>
                <p>Oh Jeff. If you weren't a Bears fan I can't help but wonder what your 0-4 record post-trade would look like if you just kept your original guys..</p>
                <p>Week 7</p>
                <ul>
                <li>J Rob: Bye</li>
                <li>Pittman: 18pts</li>
                <li>Harris: 24pts</li>
                <li>Woods: 12pts</li>
                <li>Khalil Herbert: 15pts</li>
                <li>Montgomery: Dead</li>
                <li>Fields: 1pt</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any of the 10 QB's available on the Free Agent list: 10+ pts</p>
                <p>I think we're talking 4-0 at this point with his original team and a 3rd place 10-4 record as opposed to his now 6-8 8th place standing. Wasn't sure if Jeff was aware so I wanted to let everyone here know too. You're welcome!</p>
                <p>** Have to mention Greg with a roster churn for the ages and still pulled out this victory against Jeff. Nothing like a good old fashion roster purge 2 minutes before 2pm kickoff and Greg gave us just that. We had adds and drops flying off the shelves. But really, not sure if we congratulate Greg or just continue to shame Jeff. We'll see how Gillies makes out in Week 8.</p>

                <p>Louie is officially dead. All Nimbly Bibbly killed him. Took him to the curb and ended it. </p>
                <LazyImg alt = 'Frank X' src = {frankX}/>
                <p>This was probably Louie's best/closest chance at winning a Matchup and Frank was having none of it. Who knew Frank was a cold-blooded killer?</p>
                <p>We were all maybe even a little bit secretly rooting for Louie and thought we might see a Murray Miracle for the ages.. Then he got hurt and went into the dreaded blue tent and we all accepted Louie would never win a game the rest of his life with this roster. Then Murray came back and Frank's balls shrivelled up into his stomach. It came down to Indy's defence if Jeff wanted to pull off the upset and gain his first win of the season. Sadly he fell 4 points short and lost to All Nimbly Bibbly 91-87 in your Tightest Matchup of the Week. He's officially 0-14 and we all couldn't be happier to see it.</p>

        <p>We only have 25MB available so we're out of space. Let's focus on some of the High's to wrap things up. Andy Can't Read is on a hot streak. 10 straight wins and has solidified himself in the top 3 only two games behind NPC and Mon Cunt. With a few other matchups coming down to the wire it's looking like 4th to 6th place is up for grabs. Week 8 can't come soon enough.</p>
