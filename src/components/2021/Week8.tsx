        <p>8 Weeks into the season and what have we learned? Never bet on the goddamn Bungles! There, there's your PSA for 2021. Survivor Pools are the goddamn worst!</p>
        <p>What a weekend of football folks. The fudge packers upset the Cards, the Jets upset the red hot Bengals, Titans with the OT comeback winner, Falcons did Falcons things and blew a very winnable game against the terrible Panthers. Big Ben isn't dead yet and proved that with a win over the Browns and last but not least how bout dem Patriots!? They're back to 4-4 and just beat up on a good Chargers offense led by Herbert and Ekeler for what feels like the 30th time in a row. They're now only one game back of the Bills for first place in the AFC East and everyone's nightmare is about to start over from scratch. Mac Jones baby! LOOK AT HIS PACE, CURTIS!!</p>
        <p>Now, onto fantasy. We had a lot of Power Shifts going on this week so let's take a look at how things stand after 8 weeks.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>RuCunt might be the most insufferable fantasy player of all time. While we're all happy to see he's lost Henry for the season and used his #1 waiver priority on a Defense last week that he just dropped before this week but god dammit he just keeps on winning. Even without Henry he managed a 97-96 win over the "Unbeatable" Andy Can't Breathe in your tightest matchup of the week and stole the 6th spot victory over the Median. Great job Curtis. This is RuCunt's second 1 point victory and when you mix in the other wins he's gotten because Jeff thought he'd start Fields on a whim over Herbert or Ron benching 200 points against him there's only one conclusion left. Rupe is Mr. Insufferable.</p>
                <p>Yeah yeah I made this ages ago but it still applies here and it's incredible. Get off my ass, I'm tired, salty and ain't getting paid for this shit.</p>
                <LazyImg alt = 'Mr. Insufferable' src = {mrInsufferable}/>
                <p>And with only 5 weeks left until playoffs and Rupe now sitting alone in First Place, let's just hope his luck is about to run out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Speaking of First Place, NPC has completely shit the bed. No excuses. Time to hit the panic button? What should have been an easy comeback win for NPC vs Frank the Tank turned out to be a total failure. Mahommes looks lost out there and it's hurting Kelce in a big way. Instead of putting up 40 points like one might expect on a Monday Nighter vs the Giants they combined for 17 and NPC lost an embarrassing one 93-80. NPC might want to cool down the smack talk, take a step back and lay low for a while until he rights the ship.</p>
                <LazyImg alt = 'Homer Dave' src = {homerDave}/>
                <p>That's an 0-2 on the week and a slide from 1st place to 2nd place, 2 games behind Mr. Insufferable. Pathetic. But hey, sometimes you just need a reality check and I think that's exactly what All Nimbly Bibbly gave NPC. Week 9 vs AndyCan't Breathe is shaping up to be a doozy.</p>
                <LazyImg alt = 'Dave reality check' src = {daveRealityCheck}/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Week 8's most exhilarating matchup probably came between two feisty teams hungry for a win. It had everything you could hope for in a game between two last place teams battling it out for that prime "2nd worst record" draft pick. Including Louie's WR1, Russel Gage, playing the entire game and putting up a stat line of 0 yards on 0 receptions on 0 targets. Impressive.</p>
                <LazyImg alt = 'Upset louie' src = {upsetLouie}/>
                <p>Honourable mention goes to Gregs TE who also put up a goose egg but at least he had 3 targets. Greg's Defence was also his highest scorer with 17 points which isn't ideal but I think Louie wins this one with his kicker...</p>
                <p>How good is Louie's kicker!!? Bags the highest point total for his whole squad with 15 points. More points than his WR1, his WR2, his TE and his Flex player COMBINED! What a stud, what a matchup. Unfortunately for Louie, his Kickers heroics weren't enough as he fell to Greg and Median 67-92. Sitting at 0-16 with a perfect season still on the horizon. Remarkable! He faces the 7-9 Rippers in Week 9 and current projections have LouCrew as 58% favourites! The Rippers are SCURRRED!</p>
                <LazyImg alt = 'Ryan Scared' src = {ryanScared}/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wrap up. Rondinko's your Highest Scorer of the week 133-98 over the Rippers. Also your Biggest blow out. Congrats to Nox for squeezing into that 6th playoff spot with a big 2-0 victory over Moran who seems to be skating along with TWO back to back victories over the Median.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Week 9 is looking like another big one for the standings as this playoff picture is starting to unfold. A lot of bodies are trying to squeeze into those top 6 spots. Set those lineups fellas!</p>
