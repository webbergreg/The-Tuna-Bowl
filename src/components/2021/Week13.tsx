        <p>Apologies for the delay on the recap. Found myself up until 3 am on a Monday night bender celebrating and to be honest, slept from 7pm Tuesday until 6am Wednesday morning! Better late than never though so let's get into it.</p>
        <p>Well that was something. Listen, I don't want to have to do this but I'm not sure it's something that can be ignored. I pride myself on being an unbiased Tuna Bowl reporter. That's why the Commish pays me the big bucks to report on all things football and Tuna Bowl. Again, I don't normally like to focus on one team or one game in particular when I sit down and get these recaps going but come on. Did anyone see that masterpiece on Monday night!</p>
        <p>I'd report on all the Sunday action but frankly, I blacked out as soon as we kicked off Monday night, Pats vs Bills in Orchard Park. When you've got a division game with top seed in the AFC on the line vs Bills Mafia and co in a goddamn Tornizzard with 60mph winds you best be ready! And bahhgawd were the Pats ready! </p>
        <p>Just a thing of beauty. Belichick's game plan was simple and debilitating. Run Through A Motherfuckers Face, over and over again! </p>
        <LazyImg src = {runThrough} alt ='Run Through'/>
        <p>Mac Jones did what he had to do in those conditions and contributed to the cause for an acceptable 66% completion percentage, averaging 4 yards per carry and no turnovers. Respectable. But this game wasn't about Mac passing. It was about Belichick and McDaniels completely out coaching and bullying the Bills en route to a 14-10 victory. 45 rush attempts. Incredible. The Bills knew they were running every play and couldn't do anything about it. You just gotta respect it. With that win, the Patriots now have sole possession of the AFC East and are the number 1 seed in the AFC. The world's nightmare is starting to take shape. The Pats are looking like the most complete team in the AFC and you just KNOW the Bucs are winning the NFC. Belichick vs Brady. Oh god, I've got goosebumps! Can you FEEL IT!!?? HUH CAN YOU! WOOOOO!!</p>
        <p>With that, let's get right into some of the highlights from Week 13 league play. We had two big matchups that came down to the Monday nighter. NPC vs There's Something About Murray and The Mutts vs Rucunt. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>1. NPC coming off a loss to the Rucunt week 12 and a 1-1 record was desperately looking for a big week against Louie. Unfortunately for him Mahomey, Kelce and CEH put up a pathetic 25 points on Sunday night, he found himself in a dead heat showdown vs Louie going into the Monday night game, 87-87. Louie starting two bad RBs on the Bills is never an ideal situation but all they had to do was put up more points than the Patriots D. He was certainly favoured, but mother nature had a different plan and apparently so did Sean McDermott. After the Brieda fumble(I don't care what Sleeper says) early in the game McDermott shockingly seemed to pull both Singledigit and Breida and went with Zack Moss for the rest of the game. It came down to 4th and 14th on the 20 for the Bills with under 2 minutes left in the game. TD and Louie gets his first H2H victory of the season. Defensive stop and NPC goes 1-1 and holds onto first place over the RuCunt.. Allen drops back, throws to the open receiver in the middle of the endzone and OUTTA NOWHERE, MYLES BRYANT SWATS IT OUTTA THE AIR ON THE 3 YARD LINE!! NPC WINS!! NPC WINS!! LOUIES DEAD!! LOUIES DEAD!! What a game! The exact second when NPC ripped Louie's heart out! KALI MA LOUIE!! KALI MAAAAAAA!!!</p>
                <LazyImg src = {kaliMa} alt = 'KALIMAAAAAA!!!'/>
                <p>But in all seriousness, that's two horrendous weeks in a row for NPC. I'm not sure if he ever would have recovered from losing to Louie's winless squad. He really dodged a bullet here folks and I'm thinking he must be worried going into week 14 with 1st place on the line..</p>
                <LazyImg src = {matrix} alt = 'Dave in the matrix'/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Our second big matchup of the week came down to Rucunt and The Mutts. RuCunt trying to move past NPC into 1st and The Mutts desperately trying to squeeze into the playoffs. RuCunt was up 128-113 going into Monday Night and just needed to stave off Stefon Diggs. With weather like that, Diggs only got one chance and he dropped it. A 50 yard TD right off his hands in the middle of the 3rd quarter. That woulda done it as Diggs still managed 7 points but The Mutts fell 8 points short to the Insufferable RuCunt. Nox may never recover.. especially if he doesn't go 2-0 vs Louie in Week 14.</p>
                <LazyImg src = {DiggsNox} alt = 'Dave in the matrix'/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Our third game between Moran and Webber would be worth mentioning under normal circumstances since they had 5 guys playing. But with weather like that you just can't expect much from a QB and 4 WR's, combined the 5 of them accounted for maybe 20 points and Webbers guys only got 4 of them. Just didn't stand a chance in those conditions. Moran goes 2-0 on the week and moves into 4th. Moran's entire Tuna Bowl future lies on next week's matchup vs Team Nox formally known as The Rippers. Buckle up, this could get messy.</p>
                <p>Speaking of Nox's Rippers, you're a bit late to the party, pal. Your Highest Scorer of the week Ladies and Gentleman! With a crushing victory over The Nimbley Bibbleys this just seems like whipped cream on dog shit. </p>
                <LazyImg src = {ryanWhipCream} alt = 'Dog shit'/>
                <p>Sure you got the Highest Scorer award in week 13 but you currently have a 0.001% chance of making the playoffs and that my friend, is whipped cream on a pile of dog shit.</p>
                <LazyImg src = {ryanChance} alt = 'So there is a chance?'/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Timmay wins your biggest blowout over AndyCan'tBreathe's impressively bad 57 points.. Now that's the Andy we know and love. After a quick calculation, Andy is 0-6 H2H the past 6 weeks. What a plummet. What happened here? Once in 3rd place battling it out with the big dogs and now competing for 10th. Yikes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Don't sleep on the Rondinko Ate Yo Baby either. Quietly having one hell of a season as part of the expansion experiment as he just beat Gillies and Taylor to move into sole possession of 3rd place with a 15-11 record. He's heating up!</p>
        <p>Week 14 kicks off with a lot of important matchups and scenarios. NPC and RuCunt trying to lock up 1st place and technically 8 others with a chance (Yes even a small chance Nox's Rippers) at rounding out the remaining 4 spots. Should be one hell of a final week.</p>
