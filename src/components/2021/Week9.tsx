        <p>Week 9 Fellas! Sweet Christmas, what a fucking week of football. The dogs were hungry. Jags humiliated the Bills, Falcons upset the Saints, the G-Men bullied the Raiders, Browns bulldozed the Bungles, the Broncos embarrassed the Cowgirls, the Henryless Titans even beat the god damn Rams! Hell, we almost had DA Bears upset the Steelers in a coulda/woulda/shoulda Monday nighter. The Bears might have a case against the refs in that game. Usually it is what it is but that one seemed extremely lopsided in favour of the Steelers. Ah well, it's just DAA Bears and at least it's only Jeff losing sleep over it. The DOINK off the crossbar for the game winning FG was just icing on the cake. Other than that, the Pats continue their dominance on the road with their 4th straight road win over the Panthers. The Chiefs look dead as they just squeaked out a 13-7 win over the Packers sans Rodgers and the Cards managed an impressive win without any of their starters including none other than Kyler Murray..</p>
        <p>SPEAKING OF MURRAY!! Team LouCrew, haha wow. This was it. This was honestly looking like LouCrew's best chance at a W so far this season. Louie had the Rippers right where he wanted them and then he did the unthinkable... He started Kyler Murray who was legit questionable for days and gave himself no back up plan. On top of that, he then tried to plead with the fucking Tunas of all people, that he thought he could drop players who have already played after their game!? And all his other leagues allow that? I could go on and on but it's not really necessary and James Connor squashed any chances of that anyway when he took over the game dropping 40 points all over LouCrews face. Connor has that IT factor and it's about time he gets the recognition he deserves.</p>
        <p>And speaking of Kyler Murray... We have our second roster violation of the season. Goodbye LouCrew, hello "There's Something About Murray!" Here's your new team name and logo Louie. Thank you for making this all possible. It might be my favourite to date! Feel free to use the small headshot for your Sleeper Avatar so we can all enjoy that grill!</p>

        <p>Now that that's out of the way let's get down to some of the other highlights of the week.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>The King is dead. Without star Running Back Derrick Henry, RuCunt showed us who he really is. A fantasy owner with 4 Backup RB's behind Henry and the rest could be history. Mr. Insufferable managed a paltry 74 points against Frank and went 0-2 on the week. That's two H2H losses on the season for RuCunt against NPC and the Nimbly Bibbly. Two strong playoff contenders taking care of business. That's reason enough for celebration. The King is Dead!</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Don't look now but not one, but TWO Gillies are grinding for the playoffs and one of them just got his prized possession back from IR. Jeff DAA Bears Gillies might be onto something. Trade away valuable assets early in hopes Jonathan Taylor carries your team long enough so you can use those equally valuable assets you traded for that are now good and rested.. Did that make any sense? We're about 6 beers deep at this point, try and bear with me.. While Moran was busy getting Murdered by the Median again for what feels like the 78th time this year, Gillies was stealing his wallet and waltzing his way back into playoff contention. Jeff's on a 4 game Win streak and David Montgomery is back from the dead!</p>
            <img alt = {`Monty's back`} src = {montysBack}/>
            <p>Look out!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In other news, NPC is back on top with a dominating win over AndyCantBreathe and wins another Highest Scorer of the week award. The Rondingo continues to go under the radar, sneaking out wins and clinging to that last playoff spot. And almost forgot to mention, There's Something About Murray is still undefeated in his quest for the perfect 0-26 season. He sits at 0-18 and faces off against Moran in week 10.. What a week!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>This just in, Moran follows up another 0-2 week by mortgaging his future with another trade that reeks of desperation in hopes of sneaking into the playoffs. Love it. If Moran doesn't beat Louie with his new toy, I'll personally pay for Moran's funeral the following Tuesday because there's no way he recovers from that scenario.</p>
          </li>
          <p>Thursday's just around the corner. Don't forget to set those lineups Tunas!</p>
