        <p>Sweet fancy moses, quite a week of Football.</p>
        <p>What did we learn? </p>
        <p>Always start your studs.</p>
        <img alt = {`I've hade a huge mistake`} src = {mistake}/>
        <p>Jeff “DAAAA BEARS” Gillies just can’t help himself. Herbert in a KC shootout or Justin Fields first career start against a stout Cleveland D? Annnnd that’s the ball game folks. Fields mustered a shockingly bad 68 yards passing (2 more than Tuckers Game Winning FG for reference) for a grand total of 3.9 points vs Herbert’s 30 burger which would have given Jeff the W. Against Rupe’s team no less. A team we’d all be happy to see lose every single week. Yet here we are and Rupe sits in 2nd at 5-1 scratching at the top spot. How about this name for your team, Jeff? “This Justin…Fields Sucks!” (not bad)</p>
        <p>Moran’s team is better than his previous 0-4 record would have led us to believe. After an early trade for Edmunds and Andrews where we saw him mortgage his 2022 season, Moran just MURDERED the MEDIAN and not to mention leaving Martins bloody corpse on the side of the highway while he was at it. Moran over Martin 170 to 85 and that’s your biggest blowout of the week folks. This continues, Moran might have to change his name to “Saved by the Median???” (not great)</p>
        <p>Another big turnaround was AndyCantRied’s big win over Webber this weekend. Another 0-4 team showing some life with a big win against their opponent and the dreaded Median. Big shout out to Curt. First time breaking 100 points in his last 16 starts. Bound to happen at some point, just sad to see the streak end. Curt, did you hear Andy was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance after the game? Might want to think about changing your team name to “AndyCantBreathe” AMMMIIIRIGHT!!!? (poor taste)</p>
        <p>While we’re talking about winless teams lets focus in on Louie who went into the week against, Nox The Dogpound Mutt sitting at 0-4. There was hope he might scrape out a victory but then we saw something we don’t normally see this early in a football season. A pre-week 3 IDGAF yard sale. Ya hate to see it. Louie’s team just went from bad to worse and he’s now eyeing a perfect 0-26 season as well as the Minnow. Sad look for our defending Champ. Might want to consider a name change, LouCrew. How about “LouBlew….It”  (Just terrible)</p>
        <p>Speaking of perfect seasons… Our two 4-0 teams, NPC and The Rondinko Ate Yo Baby came crashing back to earth this week. Both teams put up some low numbers but it was NPC who comes out with the victory and narrowly edges out the Median 105.5 to 105.46. The winning streak continues as NPC sits at 6-0 and eyeing a juicy week 4 matchup vs “This Justin….I’m 30 Point Underdog Again.” LOVE IT!</p>
        <p>Storyline for next week has to be who breaks the quest for the Perfect Season. NPC or Lou’s Crew of Misfits. Bring on week 4!</p>
        <p>Warning… The Pats look terrible. Now we got Tommy and Gronky coming to town and I’m just not sure I can take it. If you don’t find a week 4 recap in your inbox by mid next week I’m likely dead. Good luck in week 4!</p>
