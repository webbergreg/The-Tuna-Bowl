       <p>Week 12 kicked off with Thanksgiving Thursday. Pretty standard stuff here guys. DAAA Bears and Lions had a nasty game that nobody will ever ever remember. Raiders squeaked out a close one over dem Cowboys and the Bills annihilated the Saints. Sunday had some ups and downs. The corpse of Big Ben getting trounced by the Bungles was tough to watch. Eagles/Giants in a classic NFC East showdown with the Giants winning 13-7 was somehow less memorable than the Bears/Lions game. Bucs/Colts game was, however, a doozy where we saw Uncle Lenny take over the game with 4 TDs in an absolute barn burner with the Bucs winning 38-31. And last but not least, I have to mention those pesky Patriots..</p> 
       <p>And just like that, The New England Football Patriots are back in 1st place in the AFC East and 2nd place in all of the AFC just one game behind the Baltimore Ravens. Once upon a time sitting at 2-4 with a 21% chance of making the playoffs they've won 6 straight in dominating fashion and now face a 91% chance of making the playoffs. Just forcing their will upon opposing teams. I for one am here for Revenge Bill. These Pats are on fire. Number 1 in Point Differential with a +146 on the season. In case you didn't know, Curtis, that's a very important stat in determining football winners. Bill Belichick, Coach of the Year, Mac Jones, Rookie of the year. Ya just gotta love it! With more wins so far this season than they had all of last year with 5 games left to play, you have to be excited about this team!</p>
       <p>But enough about that red hot team. Let's shift our focus to the hottest team in the Tuna Bowl. Team LouCrew has done it again! 0-2 baby! This was it! So close to beating that median but Nox said, "Hey Rondinko Baby! nice 105-100 victory. Let me finish this Louuuuuser off!" and WHAMMEY out of nowhere from the top ropes to squash every bit of hope LouCrew had left! HE'S DEAD!!!</p>
       <LazyImg src = {wwe} alt =''/>
       <p>Louie misses the median by 10 points after DK Metcalf lights it up on Monday Night and continues his quest for the perfect season. He sits at 0-24 and only has 2 weeks left to do the impossible. The first person ever to go winless in fantasy football with an extra matchup a week vs the Median. God speed, LouCrew! We're all pulling for you!</p>

            "Wait.. What's that?"<br/><br/>
            "What do you mean DK didn't have a target until the 4th quarter?"<br/><br/>
            "Sooo he scored the 6 points needed before time expired and The Dogpound Mutts won the 6th and last Median spot, right?"<br/><br/>
            "What?.. he only got 2 points.? hahaha oh Nox.."<br/><br/>
            "Shit.. So that means, LouCrew...LouCrew won a matchup?"<br/><br/>
            "Fuck.. OK.. Let me just reel it back here.. I can still make this work."<br/><br/>
       </p>
       <p>A MONDAY NIGHT MIRACLE!! Louie from the top ropes puts the Mutts in their place! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! You Suck Nox!!</p>
       <LazyImg className = 'inline' src = {top_ropes} alt =''/><LazyImg className = 'inline' src = {you_suck} alt =''/>
       <p>What a turn of events. Who would have thought. I mean, happy for LouCrew but sad to see the ride end. It truly has been fun. Ah well, it'll make it all that much more exciting when Moran's Meatballs go 0-28 next year. In case anyone has missed the news, Moran doesn't pick until the 6th round next season, assuming he keeps Adams with his final 5th. Things could get ugly.</p>
       <p>Moving along.. We've got NPC and RuCunt still in the top two spots at 19-5 and 18-6, officially locked in to make the playoffs. Meanwhile we're still having massive turnover in the final 4 spots. Since last week it looks like all 4 positions in the standings have changed. Nox goes from 3rd to 7th, Moran from 8th to 6th, Jeff Gillies is back in 3rd, with Bimmblys and Rondinko rounding out the 4th and 5th spots. What a trip!</p>
       <p>Congrats to Gillies on back to back Biggest Blowout awards. This week it came down to his 37 point win over the Mutts. Jesus, The Mutts are taking a beating this week! </p>
       <LazyImg src = {nooooooo} alt =''/>
       <p>What a fall from grace. After trading away picks for Diggs, Kamara, Prescott and the Eagles for that playoff push, he suddenly finds himself on the outside looking in with only 2 weeks to go. Not great, Bob!</p>
       <p>Other things to note. The trade deadline has passed us by. We had a fair amount of moves go on leading up to this but it was capped off last night by Moran selling what LITTLE value he had left in 2022's Draft. Sending two 5th rounders off for a kicker and a 5th string Running Back. Desperate times fellas. This might set Moran back 3 years and Minnow Trophy after Minnow Trophy. I can't wait.</p>
       <p>I'll wrap things up now because it's just come to my attention, The Mutts also won the Worst Manager Of The Week award and I'm not sure he can take much more abuse...

       <p>Sorry Mutts.. I warned whoever ruined Louie's perfect season would be on the shit list.</p>
       <p>Cheers, Tunas!</p>
